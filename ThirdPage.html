  <p>This chapter covers the Roman Empire between the time period of 30BC to 400AD</p>
  <p>There are two types of Roman citizens:
      <ul>
          <li>Patricians</li>
          <li>Plebians</li>
     </ul>    
  
    
    <p>The 'plebians' were the poor people in the Roman Empire</p>
    <p>The 'patricians' were the rich people in the Roman Empire</p>   
    <p>The Roma army was very big. The soilders were very disiplined, they were trained to march more than 30 kilometres per day</p>
    <p>The army was divided into legions. Each legion had about 5,000 soilders and there were 30 legions in total</p>
    <p>The soilders had to serve for 20 years. They had to Roman sitizens to most were sons of previous soilders</p>
    <p>The Roman Empire also had an auxilia. These was a back up army</p>
    <p>Patricians lived very well compared to the plebians. A very rich Roman family would live in a big country house called a villa. In the town they're house was called a domus.</p>
    <p>The plebians lived in blocks of flats called insulaes. these houses were built out of wood and this is why there were no fires allowed in them cause they can burmn down.</p>
    <p>In these times education was very strict. It was really only patrician sons who were able to afford an  education. Girls were not allowed go to school they're main job was to stay at home and clean and provide children.</p>
    <p.Patricians men dressed very well compared to the patricians. They wore a toga wich was the official dress of the people, these totgas were knee height tunics.</p>
    <p> They're main source of entertainment were the Roman baths.</p>
