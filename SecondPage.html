<h1 style="color:Red;">Historians and Archeologists</h1>
  
  <p>Historians are a bit like detectives. They try to piece together the story of what happened from the evidence available.</p>
<p>In Junior Certificate History, "Historians and Archeologists" is the first topic to be covered</p>
  <p>In this topic, we learn about first and secondary sources and how archeologists work on a site.</p>
  <p>We also learn about how Historians date artifacts.</p>
