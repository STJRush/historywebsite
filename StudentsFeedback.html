  <h1 style="color:red;">Students Feedback</h1>
  
  <h1 style="color:rgb(102, 153, 255); text-align:center;">While making this website, we decided to ask the students questions about learning history at St Josephs Rush.</h1>    
  <h1 style="color:rgb(102, 153, 255); text-align:center;">Here's what they said:</h1>   
   
    
      
   <p style="color:rgb(145, 100, 255); ">Interview with Luke</p>  
  
      <p>Question 1. What do you like about History?</p>
      <p>           There is a lot of interesting things on the course</p>
    
      
      <p>Questions 2. How do you fell on the new Junior Cert getting rid of certain topics?</p>
      <p>The first year part isn't needed so much but should keep revolutions and plantations</p>
    
    
      <p>Question 3. What was the most interesting topic you learned?</p>
      <p>           Irish history, because you learn about what happened in your country</p>
    
    
      <p>Question 4. Will you be doing Leaving Cert history and why?</p>
      <p>           Yes, because I feel there are more parts I would like to know about</p>
    
    
      
  <p style="color:rgb(145, 100, 255); ">Interview with James</p> 
      <p>Question 1. What do you like about History?</p>
      <p>           I like the World Wars because they are the most interesting than others</p>
    
      
      <p>Questions 2. How do you fell on the new Junior Cert getting rid of certain topics?</p>
      <p>           I think Early Ireland being taken out is good because it was a drag, bad that theyr'e getting rid of the Renaissance and the Revolutions.</p>
    
    
      <p>Question 3. What was the most interesting topic you learned?</p>
      <p>           World War 2 because it's one of the biggest things to happen in history, and the Age of Exploration because traveling and discorvery is important in History</p>
    
    
      <p>Question 4. Will you be doing Leaving Cert history and why?</p>
      <p>           Yes, because history is difficult but I like the challenge</p>
