<h1 style="color:Red;">The Middle Ages</h1>

    <p>The Middle Ages was a time of about AD 500 to 1500</p>
    <p>It was also known as the middle ages</p>
    <p>The feudal system, this was how land was owned and soceity was organised.</p>
    <p>Most peasants were serfs. They belonged to the lord and farmed his land. They got their own small piece of land, and in return they had to work  for free on the lordr's land. They had to pay taxes yo him and the priest</p>
    <p>Some peasants were freemen, this meant that they did not have to give free labour to the lord but paid him  rent.</p>
    <p>Peasants rarely ate meat.</p>
    <p>Life in a medieval castle: The most important person i a castle was the lord, who lived there with his family. The castle and all the land around it belonged to him. But if the lord betrayed the king he would lose it all.</p>
    <p>The lord and his family lived in the keep.</p>
    <p>Up to the 1300,s most lords could barely read or write. They had no need to, because they kept a priest to do that for them. he also acted as a schoolmaster to the lord's sons until they were seven years old.</p>
    <p> Rich men wore long tunics. Shoes were made of leather and were pointed. The long toes were stuffed with horse hair.</p>
    <p> When a lord had control of a country side he replaced the moat and bailey castles with stones castles, this is the main features of a stone castle:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Keep</li>
        <li>The Battlements</li>
        <li>Curtain Walls</li>
        <li>Turrets</li>
        <li>Drawbridge</li>
